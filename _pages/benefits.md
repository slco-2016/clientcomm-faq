title:  "Benefits of ClientComm"
---

### Why you should use this tool in your work

- ClientComm allows each party to send messages and respond at their convenience. This reduces interruptions to their day, allowing them to be more efficient with their time, potentially to spending more time with each client. 
Creating templates allow staff to send common messages quickly.
- Notifications can be created when time permits, enabling staff to better optimize their time as well as to set notifications easily and for appointments or reminders other than those formally required or otherwise mandated.
- Capturing multiple phone numbers and email addresses for each client allows staff to quickly reach a client from a backup number if they stop responding to their main contact number. 
- Having a record of communication also allows clients to refresh their memory of appointment times and important supervision details.
