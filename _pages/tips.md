### First time you text a client

- Enter them into your ClientComm caseload and send them their first message while they are in your office. This allows you to make sure that you entered in their contact information correctly and makes sure that your client has given you the right information. 
- Why do this? This way your number is already in their phone if they want to message with you.

### Ask for a follow up response 

- Some case managers have been successful at getting a reply from non-communicative clients by adding at the end of a message a request for them to let them know they received the message.

### Add backup contact methods

- The more contact methods you have for your client on ClientComm, the more likely you are to stay in communication with them in times of crisis or if they lose a phone. Enter at least two contact methods per client.
