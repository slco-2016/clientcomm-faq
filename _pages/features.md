-  Emails are sent from individual accounts in the format: `CaseManagerEmail.Organization@ClientComm.org`.
    +  For example, if your email was `sarahd@slco.org`, your ClientComm email address would be `sarahd.sclo@clientcomm.org`.

### Unknown numbers

- When a client sends a message from a phone that is not associated with their ClientComm account it goes to the “Unclaimed” page.
- To have their new number attached to their client profile on your caseload, click the “Claim” button.

### Who can send messages?

- Primary Users—case managers and therapists with individual client caseloads. Case managers and therapists can have overlapping clients but do not have message overlap because ClientComm V4 has a number for therapists to use that is distinct from the case manager number.
- Support Staff— Front office staff can messages to any client waiting to be assigned a case manager.
- Supervisors —Can send messages to all clients within a department which is useful to remind them about office closures and other important announcements.
